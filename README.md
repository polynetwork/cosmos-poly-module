## Instruction

cosmos-poly-module is developed for any cosmos sub chain to integrate with PolyNet conveniently. 

The framework and underlying principle interpretation can be found [here](https://github.com/polynetwork/docs/blob/master/cosmos/README.md).

## Integration

This library of modules contains five modules.
```markdown
1. ccm: cross chain manager module
2. headersync: poly chain header synchronization module
3. lockproxy: proxy module for locking and unlocking asset between cross chain transaction
4. btcx: interoperable asset module for chains like BTC
5. ft: interoperable fungible token module without using lockproxy module 
``` 

The details about each module and the method of integration can be found [here]()

## Underlying Workflow
Please refer to [cosmos cross chain workflow documentation](https://github.com/polynetwork/docs/blob/master/cosmos/cosmos_cross_chain_workflow.md).
